# C-Basic-Data-Structures
Basic data structures implemented from scratch in pure, old-fashioned C.

The goals of this project are to strengthen my knowledge of, and experience working with, C and to refresh my knowledge of basic 
data structures. These data structures are all implemented from scratch without the standard library. The data structures also
include basic operations associated with them, but nothing advanced enough to consider an algorithm.

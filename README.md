# Basecamp
A header-only library of basic data structures and algorithms implemented from
scratch in C89.
This project is an exploration of how to implement basic OOP-like data structures and algorithms with only C89.

## Project Navigation
At the top of this repository, there is a 'deps' folder for the Unity testing
framework and a folder for each data structure and algorithm header. In each
sub-folder is the header for that data structure or algorithm, examples of
usage, and unit tests.

## Using Headers
To use a header just find it, download it, paste it in your project, and
`#include` it. That's it. All headers are public domain, no need to fumble with
licensing details. However, you cannot remove my name as author from any header
you include in your project. That would be plagiarism.

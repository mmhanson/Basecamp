# C-Basic-Data-Structures
Basic data structures implemented from scratch in pure, old-fashioned C.

The goal of this project is to strengthen my knowledge and experience working with C and to refresh my knowledge of basic data 
structures. These data structures are all implemented from scratch without the standard library. The data structures also
include basic operations associated with them, but nothing advanced enough to consider an algorithm.
